# 👋 Hey, I'm Satwik Singh Chauhan  

### Founder of [Axiorium](https://satwiksinghchauhan.github.io/axiorium/) — bridging mind, machine, and meaning.

---

### 🚀 About Me  
I’m an 11th-grade researcher and developer focused on **AI, BCI, and neurotech integration**.  
I build under **AxoSync** — a hub of experimental projects that aim to merge digital systems with human cognition.  

My long-term goal: to make **full-brain interface technology** safe, accessible, and meaningful.  

---

### 🧠 Currently working on
- **Neural Interface Platform (NerveGear-Inspired)** — immersive BCI prototype for real-world applications.  
- **Axiorium Framework** — the foundation layer for AI-BCI synchronization and sensory feedback.  
- Conceptual blueprints for **nanotech-based signal relays** and **mechanical augmentation systems** (AX-MECH).

---

### 📅 Roadmap
- **Now:** Building solo while balancing school and core R&D work.  
- **Next:** Form a small team post-college to advance neural interface research.  
- **Later:** Expand into robotics and nanotech integration.
